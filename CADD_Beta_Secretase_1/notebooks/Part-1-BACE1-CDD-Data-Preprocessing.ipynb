This cleavage is the first step in the formation of $\\beta$-amyloid peptides, which are a major component of the plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. As such, $\\text{BACE-1}$ is a significant therapeutic target for developing treatments for Alzheimer's .\n","\n","### 📉 Understanding Bioactivity Units ($\\text{IC50}$ and $\\text{pIC50}$)\n","•\t$\\text{IC50}$ (Half maximal inhibitory concentration) is the standard unit used to measure the potency of an inhibitor1. Lower $\\text{IC50}$ values indicate higher drug potency2.\n","\n","•\t$\\text{pIC50}$ is the negative logarithm of the $\\text{IC50}$ ($\\text{pIC50} = -\\log_{10}(\\text{IC50})$)3.

Briefly, the recombinant protease unit of BACE1 was prepared from E. coli expression as inclusion bodies, refolded, and purified as described in Lin, et al., (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 97:1456-1460 (2000)). Fluorogenic substrate, MCA-SEVNLDAEFK(DNP)-NH2 (SEQ ID NO:1) was purchased. (M-2485, Bachem Americas, Torrance, Calif.). The substrate was derived from 10 amino acids of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP), with the Swedish variant amino acids at the beta-secretase cleavage site. The terminal amino acid was modified from arginine to lysine to facilitate derivatization with a functional group for detection by autofluorescence.\",\n          \"Inhibition of BACE1 expressed in

Briefly, the recombinant protease unit of BACE1 was prepared from E. coli expression as inclusion bodies, refolded, and purified as described in Lin, et al., (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 97:1456-1460 (2000)). Fluorogenic substrate, MCA-SEVNLDAEFK(DNP)-NH2 (SEQ ID NO:1) was purchased. (M-2485, Bachem Americas, Torrance, Calif.). The substrate was derived from 10 amino acids of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP), with the Swedish variant amino acids at the beta-secretase cleavage site. The terminal amino acid was modified from arginine to lysine to facilitate derivatization with a functional group for detection by autofluorescence.\",\n          \"Inhibition of BACE1 expressed in

The substrate was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in DMSO.The assay was performed in the presence of OptiMEM (supernatant collected over 24 h and cleared from cellular debris by centrifugation) containing the ectodomain of BACE1, 25 ul water containing the desired 2-fold concentration of test compound and 2% DMSO, 1 uM substrate peptide, 20 mM NaOAc, pH 4.4, and 0.04% Triton-X100 in a total assay volume of 50 ul in a 384 well plate. In general, 25 ul of compound dilution were given to the plate followed by the addition of 10 ul of BACE1 containing OptiMEM diluted 1:10 in water with 0.2% Triton X-100. The reaction was started with the addition of 15 ul substrate in NaOAc buffer. The reaction was incubated at rt (dark) in an Envision multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer) and the cleavage of the substrate was recorded as kinetic for 60 min at ex: 485 nm, em: 538 nm. Blank wells containing no enzyme were included on each plate. The intensity of fluorescence was regressed against time in order to derive velocities of reaction in all 384 wells. These velocities were used for calculating percent control using an uninhibited control containing 1% DMSO as 100% and blank control performed in the absence of enzyme as 0%. IC50 values were calculated by fitting percent control vs. test compound concentration using Assay Explorer.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"assay_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"B\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"molecule_chembl_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8172,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"CHEMBL5075933\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"=\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"standard_units\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"nM\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"standard_value\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 27091043.38205234,\n        \"min\": 0.0002,\n        \"max\": 1000000000.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2534,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1247.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target_chembl_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"CHEMBL4822\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target_organism\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Homo sapiens\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"IC50\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":27}],"source":["#Reset the ordering number since prunning has scattered it a bit\n","bioactivities_df1.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\n","bioactivities_df1.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":28,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":128,"status":"ok","timestamp":1762518766276,"user":{"displayName":"Muyideen Sadibo","userId":"00623930081306965023"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"3kZuQDNi8y3B","outputId":"563e4400-5db6-4076-b43f-5dda8b9d369f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   activity_id assay_chembl_id  \\\n","0        78857    CHEMBL653511   \n","1       391560    CHEMBL653332   \n","2       391983    CHEMBL653512   \n","3       395858    CHEMBL653512   \n","4       395859    CHEMBL653512   \n","\n","                                   assay_description assay_type  \\\n","0  Inhibitory activity against Beta-secretase 1 w...

The substrate was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in DMSO.The assay was performed in the presence of OptiMEM (supernatant collected over 24 h and cleared from cellular debris by centrifugation) containing the ectodomain of BACE1, 25 ul water containing the desired 2-fold concentration of test compound and 2% DMSO, 1 uM substrate peptide, 20 mM NaOAc, pH 4.4, and 0.04% Triton-X100 in a total assay volume of 50 ul in a 384 well plate. In general, 25 ul of compound dilution were given to the plate followed by the addition of 10 ul of BACE1 containing OptiMEM diluted 1:10 in water with 0.2% Triton X-100. The reaction was started with the addition of 15 ul substrate in NaOAc buffer. The reaction was incubated at rt (dark) in an Envision multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer) and the cleavage of the substrate was recorded as kinetic for 60 min at ex: 485 nm, em: 538 nm. Blank wells containing no enzyme were included on each plate. The intensity of fluorescence was regressed against time in order to derive velocities of reaction in all 384 wells. These velocities were used for calculating percent control using an uninhibited control containing 1% DMSO as 100% and blank control performed in the absence of enzyme as 0%. IC50 values were calculated by fitting percent control vs. test compound concentration using Assay Explorer.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n
